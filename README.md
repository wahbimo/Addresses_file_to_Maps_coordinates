# Google Geocoding API
This script takes an Excel file (it can be another type of files) containing a list of addresses, it connects to Google Geocoding API and translates the list into a list of formal addresses and coordinates (latitude,longitude,altitude). It exports the resulting table to Excel file (or another type of files).
